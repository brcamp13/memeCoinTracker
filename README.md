# Tracker for potential meme coins utilizing coinio api

## Setting up


##### Get API key from coinio
##### Create constants.py file in root dir
##### Add MEME_COIN_SEARCH_STRINGS = [] and populate w/ your meme coin search strings (mine are proprietary üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)
##### Add API_KEY = 'your api key' which you get from coinio website


## Running

##### open terminal and get cwd to be root dir of this project

##### pipenv run python main.py
##### Also, will add this functionality, but unless you are on a paid tier of the API, you will likely just want to get as many tokens as possible and then save them locally on your machine so you don't have to spam the API and use up all of your credits
